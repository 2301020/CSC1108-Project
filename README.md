# CSC 1108 - DSA Project 2024

Flight Map Routing Project

The main goal of this project is to provide users with a tool to explore various route options when traveling between airports. This includes finding the shortest path, optimizing for distance or cost, and visualizing the route options on a map interface

### Key Components

1. **Data Representation**: The project utilizes data structures to represent airports, flight connections, and routes. Graphs, such as adjacency lists or matrices, are employed to model flight connections efficiently.

2. **Algorithms**: Various algorithms are implemented or used to find optimal routes between airports. This includes algorithms for finding the shortest path, optimizing for distance and cost, exploring all possible routes, and discovering neighboring airports.

3. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface is developed to input airport codes and display route information. Visualizations, such as maps, are utilized to show flight options, shortest paths, total distances, and estimated travel times.

4. **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset obtained from OpenFlights, updated until June 2014. This dataset may be customized, such as focusing on specific regions or adding additional information like distances or costs associated with each flight.
